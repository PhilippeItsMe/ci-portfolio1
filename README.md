<h1>CHALLENGE 1 | HTLM & CSS</h1>


### Background

The LinkedIn Recruiter website is designed to offer company directors, department heads and HR and recruitment managers a tool enabling them to “hunt” for profiles matching their requirements on LinkedIn.

The service differs from headhunters in that it is much more cost-competitive, and from job boards, which generate a lot of irrelevant applications, in that it offers qualitative postings.
