### Background / Userstory

The LinkedIn Recruiter website is designed to offer company directors, department heads of and HR manager & recruiter a tool enabling them to “hunt” on LinkedIn for profiles matching their requirements.

The service differs from headhunting company in that it is much more cost-competitive, and from job boards, in that it's not generating a lot of irrelevant applications.

The website is targeting : company directors and owners, humain ressource directors,hiring manager and head hunters.

The goal of the website is to generate lead by inviting people to send a form to have a deeper presentation and understanding of the service. The goal is the same if you come for the first time and more then one time.

The website is designed to demonstrate the benefit of our solution and to give it credibily with testimonials.

The website is designed too to explain the main steps of our service to give an understanding of how it work and the potentiel benefit of it.

NEW : taking out the H4 to have a more coherent title system

NEW : adding 404 page

#### JAVASCRIPT
NEW : adding smooth scrolling JS code

#### PERFORMANCE :
Had to convert all picture to webp and set a preload line on the html head code.

<ol>
    <li>In the Github repository, navigat to Settings tab</li>
    <li>From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master branch and Save</li>
    <li> Once the Master branch is selected, the page provided the link to the website</li>
</ol>
